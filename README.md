## Portfolio Site

It's my portfolio site, put together in React to make it easy to add new projects while only touching the JSON, bundled together Parcel. Simple and straightforward and gets the job done.

To use this, you'll have to add your own profile.json and projects.json to the src/data folder, as well as any images to the src/img folder, under the content, logos, and profile section (you'll see in the code where these are loaded).  Styles can be changed to your liking.

To run local development: npm run start
To build a bundle for hosting: npm run build, and then copy the dist/ folder
